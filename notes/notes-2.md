# Class and Mobility
(Thanks to https://courses.lumenlearning.com/sociology/chapter/social-stratification-and-mobility-in-the-united-states/)

Most sociologists define social class as a grouping based on similar social factors like wealth, income, education, and occupation. Let's look at the USA and understand its class structure. 

- In the last century, the United States has seen a steady rise in its **standard of living**. Aside from the impact income has on someone’s standard of living, occupations also influence social standing through the relative levels of prestige they afford.
- There is an inequitable distribution of income and wealth. However, the poverty experienced here is most often relative poverty and not absolute poverty.
-  Whereas absolute poverty is deprivation so severe that it puts survival in jeopardy, relative poverty is not having the means to live the lifestyle of the average person in your country.

## Social Classes
Does a person’s appearance indicate class? Can you tell a man’s education level based on his clothing? Do you know a woman’s income by the car she drives?
Wealth is the most significant way of distinguishing classes, because wealth can be transferred to one’s children and perpetuate the class structure.
One sociological perspective distinguishes the classes, in part, according to their **relative power and control over their lives**. The upper class not only have power and control over their own lives but also their social status gives them power and control over others’ lives. The middle class doesn’t generally control other strata of society, but its members do exert control over their own lives. In contrast, the lower class has little control over their work or lives.

### Upper Class
Not just money or income, but lots of power. As corporate leaders, members of the upper class make decisions that affect the job status of millions of people. As media owners, they influence the collective identity of the nation. They run the major TV networks and newspapers. 

### Middle Class
Upper-middle-class people tend to hold bachelor’s and postgraduate degrees. Lower-middle-class members hold bachelor’s degrees from four-year colleges or associate’s degrees from two-year community or technical colleges. 
Middle-class people work hard and live fairly comfortable lives. Upper-middle-class people tend to pursue careers that earn comfortable incomes. In the lower middle class, people hold jobs supervised by members of the upper middle class. They fill technical, lower-level management or administrative support positions. They generally don’t have enough income to build significant savings.

### The lower/working class
Lower-class people have less of an educational background and earn smaller incomes. They work jobs that require little prior skill or experience and often do routine tasks under close supervision.

- Working-class people, the highest subcategory of the lower class, often land decent jobs in fields like custodial or food service. The work is hands-on and often physically demanding, such as landscaping, cooking, cleaning, or building.
- Beneath the working class is the working poor. Like the working class, they have unskilled, low-paying employment. They work as sharecroppers, migrant farm workers, housecleaners, and day laborers.

### Class traits
**Class traits**, also called class markers, are the typical behaviors, customs, and norms that define each class. 
People may associate the upper class with enjoyment of costly, refined, or highly cultivated tastes—expensive clothing, luxury cars, high-end fund-raisers, and opulent vacations. People may also believe that the middle and lower classes are more likely to enjoy camping, fishing, or hunting, shopping at large retailers, and participating in community activities. While these descriptions may identify class traits, they may also simply be stereotypes. Moreover, just as class distinctions have blurred in recent decades, so too have class traits. A very wealthy person may enjoy bowling as much as opera. A factory worker could be a skilled French cook. A billionaire might dress in ripped jeans, and a low-income student might own designer shoes.

## Social Mobility
**Social mobility** refers to the ability to change positions within a social stratification system. When people improve or diminish their economic status in a way that affects social class, they experience social mobility.

- Individuals can experience upward or downward social mobility for a variety of reasons. **Upward mobility** refers to an increase—or upward shift—in social class (rags to riches). Bestselling author Stephen King worked as a janitor prior to being published. There are many stories of people rising from modest beginnings to fame and fortune. People who earn a college degree, get a job promotion, or marry someone with a good income may move up socially.
- In contrast, **downward mobility** indicates a lowering of one’s social class. Some people move downward because of business setbacks, unemployment, or illness. Dropping out of school, losing a job, or getting a divorce may result in a loss of income or status and, therefore, downward social mobility.
- It is not uncommon for different generations of a family to belong to varying social classes. This is known as **intergenerational mobility**. For example, an upper-class executive may have parents who belonged to the middle class. In turn, those parents may have been raised in the lower class.
- Similarly, **intragenerational mobility** describes a difference in social class that between different members of the same generation. For example, the wealth and prestige experienced by one person may be quite different from that of his or her siblings.
- **Structural mobility** happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or down the social class ladder. Structural mobility is attributable to changes in society as a whole, not individual changes. In the first half of the twentieth century, industrialization expanded the U.S. economy, raising the standard of living and leading to upward structural mobility. 
- In today’s work economy, the recent recession and the outsourcing of jobs overseas have contributed to high unemployment rates. Many people have experienced economic setbacks, creating a wave of downward structural mobility.
