# Marxist theory of stratification:

## What does Karl Marx say about this: 

- According to Marxist theory, social stratification is created by the differing economic capacities among people and their relationships to the means or the factors of production. In a society, two distinct classes can be created which feature those who own the factors or means of production and those who sell their labor in the production chain to those who own the means. Marx also recognized two other groups that don’t belong to either but are somehow related to the two large groups: 	
1. The petite bourgeoisie - those who own some of the means of productions but their profit earning power is not enough to earn them a position among the bourgeoisie.
2. The underclass - includes those who have no social status such as beggars and the homeless.

- For Marx, social stratification comes down to the basic concept of economics. historical development has passed through the same fundamental idea where those in the position of social, economic, and political power has been based on the idea that those who control the means of production possess overall control. These individuals create a stratification system where they remain in power. Marx believes that this will change under a socialist system, where the means of production will be owned in a public setting and not a privatized one.  In making this public, stratification will presumably disappear. 

- Marx viewed class differentiation as the crucial deter­minant of social, economic and political inequality. According to Marx, there is always a dominant and a subordinate class—a ruling class and a subject class. The former (ruling class) is the class which owns the means of production (e.g., land and machinery) and the latter (subject class) sells its labour to survive. The ruling class survives its power from the ownership and control of the forces of production. The relationship between these classes has always been exploitative in all phases of history. Marx believed that primitive societies were non-class societies. In such societies, there was simple equality and as such there was no stratifi­cation based on class.. This conflict between social classes has been continuous since the dawn of history. According to a Marxian view, a class is a social group whose members share the same relationship to the forces of production.

- The society was divided into two main classes—industrialists or capitalists—those who own the means of production (factories and machinery etc.) and working class—those who earn their living by selling their labour to them. For these two classes, Marx used the terms bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and proletariat (working class).
Marx contended that those who own the means of production always try to maximise their profit at the cost of workers. The lower the wages paid, the higher the profit made by the capitalist. The wages paid to the workers for their labour are well below the value of the goods they produce. The difference between the value of the wages and commodities is known as ‘surplus value’. This surplus value is appropriated in the form of profit by the capitalists. Marx argued that capital, as such, produces nothing. Only labour produces wealth.
Thus, in the capitalist society, the relationship between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is one of mutual dependence and conflict. It is a relationship of exploiter and exploited, oppressor and oppressed. 

## Last minute Definitions

- They were considered inferior due to their race and religion. These social forces influenced the behaviour of these institutions - a quintessential example of sociological imagination. because of the social forces and beliefs that the Ivy Leagues are paramount. 
- Our social interactions almost inevitably shape our thoughts and beliefs. Our brought up affects how we present ourselves. Our beliefs and prejudices cloud our perception of reality. 

- Culture, which when very simply put, is a way of life; the social ideas and behaviour of a society. 
deviance, which refers to the violation of social norms and in some cases, laws. 

- Socialisation, which takes place when members of a society start to conform to the norms and the values and start sharing similar ideas. 

- A social structure is a set of social systems and social forces that shape the thought and behaviour of people. Our thoughts and actions are often a consequence of large scale social forces. 

- It would be cruel if we discussed about structure and not about agency as it is a very significant conceptual dichotomy in sociology. While social structures constrain and influence the actions of people, agency refers to the capacity of people to make their own choices and act independently.

- Discourse, which refers to all the social forces that shape the ideas and beliefs of people. All institutions of power proclaimed the roaches to be unfit for society and ordered them to be killed by the military, which became the prevalent discourse in the society.
