# Concepts in Sociology

## Social Stratification
(thanks to https://courses.lumenlearning.com/sociology/chapter/what-is-social-stratification/)

- Google defines stratification as the arrangement or classification of something into different groups. For instance in a sentence, *wealth is the main symbol of social stratification*.
-  Sociologists use the term social stratification to describe the system of **social standing**. It refers to a society’s categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth, income, race, education, and power.
- In geology, stratification are the distinct vertical layers found in rocks, much like social structure. **Society’s layers are made of people** , and society’s resources are distributed unevenly throughout the layers. The people who have more resources represent the top layer of the social structure of stratification. Other groups of people, with progressively fewer and fewer resources, represent the lower layers of our society.
- **People are sorted, or layered, into social categories.** Many factors determine a person’s social standing, such as income, education, occupation etc. 
- Some people also believe that everyone has an equal chance at success, depending on one's hard work, which determines the social rank. People control their own social standing. 
- In sociology, stratification is not about individual inequalities, because social stratification is created and supported by society as a whole. 

### Factors defining stratification
- Most cases, stratification is an economic system based on WEALTH, how much money one has and income. So people get categorised depending on how rich or poor they are. 
- But of course, wealth isn't the only factor. For example, in some cultures, wisdom and charisma are valued, and people who have them are revered more than those who don’t.
- For instance, neighborhoods often house people of the same social standing. Wealthy families do not typically live next door to poorer families. 
- Two systems of stratification - closed and open. Closed systems accommodate little change in social position. They do not allow people to shift levels and do not permit social relationships between levels. Open systems, which are based on achievement, allow movement and interaction between layers and classes.

## The caste system
- India used to have an extremely rigid caste system. The people in the lowest caste suffered from extreme poverty and were shunned by society.
- Caste systems are closed stratification systems in which people can do little or nothing to change their social standing.
-  A **caste system** is one in which people are born into their social standing and will remain in it their whole lives. 
- People are assigned occupations regardless of their talents, interests, or potential. There are virtually no opportunities to improve a person’s social position.
- In the Hindu caste tradition, people were expected to work in the occupation of their caste and to enter into marriage according to their caste. Accepting this social standing was considered a moral duty. 
- A person who lived in a caste society was socialized to **accept his or her social standing.**
- Although the caste system in India has been officially dismantled, its residual presence in Indian society is deeply embedded. In India’s larger cities, people now have more opportunities to choose their own career paths and marriage partners and corporations have introduced merit-based hiring and employment to the nation.
