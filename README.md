# Sociology

Apart from Computer Science, I've always had a fondness for certain Human Sciences, especially Sociology, which is simply the study of society and culture.
The fact that it's about our **everyday lives** is what entices me towards it. Here you will find some essays that I've written as part of the Sociology course at IIIT, Hyderabad.

## 1. The Chosen Ones
This is the first one that I wrote, and so far, my favourite. It is based on an article written by Malcolm Gladwell, which can be found [here.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in)
The article talks about the various educational strategies institutions use to maintain social privileges. In my term paper, I primarily talk about two very important sociological concepts:
* Sociological Imagaination 
* The Social Construction of Reality 

and elucidate how these strategies revolve around these themes. \
Score: 17.0/20.0 

## 2. Social Hierarchy of Culture and Labour
In this essay, I try to define what **culture** really is, and how the chasm between intellectual and physical labour leads to the creation of a social pyramid of culture and labour.  I also offer my take on whether I personally believe in such a division of labour and whether treating certain cultures as formidable and some as insignificant is justified. \

## 3. "You see me as I am?"

This essay gives a sociological perspective to an episode of Black Mirror, a British science fiction television series. So if you haven't seen episode number 5 of season 3 (Men against Fire), then **spoiler alert**. I look into some of the very essential concepts of sociology including structure and agency, discourse and deviance using the storyline, the characters and the dialogue in the episode. The episode turned out to be more sociological than science fiction! \
Score: 13.5/20.0

## 4. Role of caste in India

This essay attempts to characterize the role of caste in modern Indian scoiety, and how even though discrimination based on caste has been banned according to the constitution, caste continues to play a significant role in the political and economic spheres of life in India. \
Score: 16.5/20.0

## 5. Political Legitimacy

How does political legitimacy get mobilised in contemporary India? How do the rulers exercise authority and obtain the consent of the people? This essay attempts to answer this question by looking at the MGR phenomenon in Tamil Nadu, and an interesting article about the Hindu majoritarianism prevalent in India written by Christophe Jaffrelot, which can be found [here.](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hindu-rashtra-de-facto-bjp-rss-gau-rakshak-mob-lynching-5301083/) \
Score: 17.0/20.0

## 6. Development Models
Analysing the development model of the city of Rourkela with the advent of industrialization and urbabnization, using Amartya Sen's notion of development as freedom, and the 'means' and 'ends' of development. Also using Walt Rostow's development model and airplane analogy to understand the development in Rourkela in post-independent India. \
