# Sociology Term Papers

Apart from Computer Science, I've always had a fondness for certain Human Sciences, especially Sociology, which is simply the study of society and culture.
The fact that it's about our **everyday lives** is what entices me towards it. Here you will find some term papers that I've written as part of the Sociology course at IIIT. 

## The Chosen Ones
This is the first one that I wrote, and so far, my favourite. It is based on an article written by Malcolm Gladwell, which can be found [here.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in)
The article talks about the various educational strategies institutions use to maintain social privileges. In my term paper, I primarily talk about two very important sociological concepts:
* Sociological Imagaination 
* The Social Construction of Reality 

and elucidate how these strategies revolve around these themes.
